Dual Universe script that tracks the missing schematics on your industry units. It can track the entire factory and will walk you through loading schematics into each machine.

# Features

* Lists schematics that industry machines have run out of
* Can monitor an entire factory with only a core link
* Schematic loading tool to help load hungry machines with the right schematics

# Limitations

* It can only tell if a machine is missing schematics if the machine has all other required ingredients, so the list is not exhaustive.
* Can only tell when the machine is completely out of a schematic, so no warning that you're running out.

# Installation

1. Place the programming board
2. Link the programming board to the core.
4. Link the programming board to a databank.

# Usage

Run the programming board and it will display all missing schematics on the on screen widget. Press alt+1 to cycle the schematics. It will set a waypoint to an industry machine that needs the schematic and show the list of machines. Once the machine is loaded, press alt+2 and it will set the next waypoint.
